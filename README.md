# PyPaycheckPlanner -- Under Construction (Working Toward GUI)

This project was realized because of my constant need to sort and plan out my finances. I have always had a hard time thinking of a programming solution that I feel would actually benefit my every day life. Here it is... PyPaycheckPlanner. No more hours of planning out bills, just input due dates of bills and when you are paid and a schedule will be produced.
